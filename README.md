A collection of formulas for gearing calculations

## Formulas

Formuals use exact measurements (ISO) instead of nominal sizes, which may be more conventional. This provides better accuracy, but may result in values that are higher or lower than what you expect.

* development
* gainRatio
* gearInches
* gearRatio
* skidpatches
* speed

## Sizings

Wheels include ISO and nominal sizes.

* chainrings (20T-64T)
* cogs (8T-36T)
* cranks
* wheels (from Sheldon Brown's data)
